# Shower monitor

This is a Python service that periodically reads power readings from a Meross smart plug to determine when the shower pump goes on.

The purpose of the script is to monitor the water level in the hot water header tank. It requires a measurement of the flow rate of the shower and the fill rate of the header tank.

https://github.com/anyhotcountry/shower-monitor-pio is the companion app to display the tank level using an esp8266 with a led matrix.
