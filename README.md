# Shower monitor

This is a Python service that periodically read power readings from a Meross smart plug to determine when the shower pump goes on.

The purpose of the script is to monitor the water level in the hot water header tank. It requires a measurement of the flow rate of the shower and the fill rate of the header tank.
